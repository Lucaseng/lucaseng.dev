            Finance drives the world forward. 
            Enabling seamless and secure transactions excites me; it's more than just processing paymentsâ€”it's about building trust and accessibility in the digital economy.
            I believe technology should remove friction, empowering businesses to grow and people to transact with confidence.
             Seeing my work power real-world commerce, from small businesses to global platforms, drives my passion for innovation in the payments space.
