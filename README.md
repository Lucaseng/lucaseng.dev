# LUCASENG.DEV - React Rebuild

Initially, my personal portfolio was built using a simplified approach - utilising basic web technology languages like HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

As my skill-set and project repertoire improves, there was a clear need to have my portfolio built on a modern framework that could elegantly handle updates to the application.

Hence, I decided there was a need to rebuild my portfolio using React.
